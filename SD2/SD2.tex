\section*{Part A}

A good strategy would be to partition the blocks so that you can maximize the number of districts you win based on the percentage of blocks where you have the majority constituents. Very basically the area is broken into a group of blocks and all the blocks together is 100-percent of voters. Because there are only two districts, each district will have 50-percent of the population.  Additionally, the way that Alpha draws the districts will dictate what the districts will look like.  This is because once Beta picks the district it "approves" of, there would be only one more district needed and it would automatically be the other district that Alpha drew that Beta didn't pick. This means, alpha does not need to consider which district Beta would choose, and alpha should just draw the districts so that they maximize the number of districts they win.
\newline

There are three seperate cases that we must observe when $d = 2$:  Alpha has more total votes than Beta, less total votes than Beta, and Alpha has less than $\frac{1}{4}$ total votes.  
\newline

In the first case where Alpha has more total votes than Beta their strategy should be two draw two districts such that they have a majority in both.  In this case no matter which district Beta picks, Alpha will win both districts.  This works because Alpha will always have at-least two more votes than Beta and can distribute the votes such that it has a majority in both districts.
\newline

In the case that Alpha has less total votes than Beta, Alpha's strategy should be to draw their districts such that they win in one district and lose in the other. In order to be able to win both districts, Alpha would have to have $> 25 \%$ in both districts which would sum to $> 50\%$ but we know Alpha has $ < 50\%$ of the total votes. However, to win one district, Alpha only needs $> 25\%$ of the votes. Therefore, if alpha has less total votes than Beta, but $> 25\%$ of the total votes, Alpha can win at most 1 district. Maximizing the districts alpha wins means drawing the districts so that they win a majority of blocks in one of the districts. Thus, they are guranteed to win one district.
\newline

In the case that Alpha has less than $\frac{1}{4}$ total votes there is no strategy that would enable Alpha to win a district. Winning one district would require $>$50-percent in one district, but in order to have $>$50-percent requires having more than $\frac{1}{4}$ total votes. We know Alpha has $< 25\%$ of the total votes, therefore there is not strategy where they could win a district.
\newline

The PARTITION problem is NP-Hard.  Thus, what we are trying to do is hard in general because it relates to the PARTITION problem; similar to the PARTITION problem we are trying to split a multiset $S$ into two sub-sets $S_1$ and $S_2$.  However, unlike the PARTITION problem we are not trying to split them into two equal subsets, but rather different sized subsets based on Alpha's percentage of total votes.  Thus, this is at-least just as hard as the PARTITION problem.
